# GitHub-Profiles-Explorer
A React app to explore GitHub profiles 👨‍💻. Fetches random users using the GitHub API with useState and useEffect, and lets you search profiles by count input. Displays user avatar, username, and profile link. Future improvements: try/catch error handling, useCallback optimization, and name-based search.
